# Can I publish a notebook blog post?

I'm following [Christopher Corley's walkthrough](http://christop.club/2014/02/21/blogging-with-ipython-and-jekyll/), [gist](https://gist.github.com/cscorley/9144544), and [this gist from the comments on that previous gist](https://gist.github.com/tgarc/7d6901858ef708030c19).


```python
%pylab inline
```

    Populating the interactive namespace from numpy and matplotlib



```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
xs = np.arange(-10, 11, 1)
ys = np.abs(xs)
ax.plot(xs, ys);
```



```python

```
